## Research Interests
Bayesian Nonparametric Methods, Regression Modelling with High-Dimensional Data, Time Series Modelling in Econometrics and Finance

## Research Projects
- **Bayesian Nonparametric Modelling of Macroeconomic Data** - This is a joint project with [Maria Kalli](https://www.kent.ac.uk/mathematics-statistics-actuarial-science/people/1102/www.kent.ac.uk/mathematics-statistics-actuarial-science/people/1102/kalli-maria) looking into flexible modelling of macroeconomic time series.
- **Athletic Performance Passport** - This is a joint project with [James Hopker](https://www.kent.ac.uk/sport-sciences/people/2184/www.kent.ac.uk/sport-sciences/people/2184/hopker-james) identifying unusual changes in the performance of elite athletes to inform anti-doping. Recent work icludes [a Bayesian hieraarchical model for performance evolution](https://www.degruyter.com/document/doi/10.1515/jqas-2021-0112/html) and [an evaluation of performance as an indicator of doping status](https://analyticalsciencejournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/dta.3563).
- **Efficient Computational Methods for Bayesian Variable Selection** - This work involves [Sam Livingstone](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/statistics/department-information/staff/dr-samuel-livingstone) and [Xitong Liang](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Xitong_Liang3). This work looks at efficient computational methods for Bayesian variable selection in high-dimension problems and applications in areas such as genomics. Recent work includes [samplers for linear models](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11222-022-10137-8), [samplers for generalized linear models and survival analysis](https://www.mdpi.com/1099-4300/25/9/1310), and our recent Neurips paper with [Alberto Caron](https://albicaron.github.io) looking at [samplers for graphical models](https://proceedings.neurips.cc/paper_files/paper/2023/file/8027ace571384361920665f1d1b69758-Paper-Conference.pdf).
- **Expressing and visualizing model uncertainty in Bayesian variable selection** - This work develops methods for understanding model uncertainty arising in Bayesian variable selection. Initial work looks using [Cartesian credible sets](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.12323).
- **Statistical Modelling of Environmental DNA (eDNA)** - This is a joint project with [Eleni Matechou](https://www.kent.ac.uk/mathematics-statistics-actuarial-science/people/1039/matechou-eleni) and [Alex Diana](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Alex-Diana-2). We have worked on [Bayesian variable selection for model with false positives and false negative](https://rss.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/rssc.12390) for single species eDNA data. An Rshiny app is [available](https://nsojournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1111/ecog.05718). We have developed a multi-species model for biomass changes allowing for errors in eDNA data  (https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.12213).
