## Research Interests
Bayesian Nonparametric Methods, Regression Modelling with High-Dimensional Data, Time Series Modelling in Econometrics and Finance

## Research Projects
- Bayesian Nonparametric Modelling of Macroeconomic Data - This is a joint project with [Maria Kalli](https://www.kent.ac.uk/mathematics-statistics-actuarial-science/people/1102/www.kent.ac.uk/mathematics-statistics-actuarial-science/people/1102/kalli-maria) looking into flexible modelling of macroeconomic time series.
- Athletic Performance Passport - This is a joint project with [James Hopker](https://www.kent.ac.uk/sport-sciences/people/2184/www.kent.ac.uk/sport-sciences/people/2184/hopker-james) on developing methods for identifying unusual changes in the performance of elite athletes can be used to inform drug-testing programmes.
- Statistical Modelling of Environmental DNA (eDNA) - This is a joint project with [Eleni Matechou](https://www.kent.ac.uk/mathematics-statistics-actuarial-science/people/1039/matechou-eleni). We have recently worked on [Bayesian variable selection for model with false positives and false negative](https://rss.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/rssc.12390) which can be used with single species eDNA data. We are extending this approach to multiple species metabarcoding data using joint species distribution models.
- Efficient Computational Methods for Bayesian Variable Selection. This work involves [Sam Livingstone](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/statistics/department-information/staff/dr-samuel-livingstone) and [Xitong Liang](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Xitong_Liang3). This work is looking at efficient computational methods for Bayesian variable selection in high-dimension problems and applications in areas such as genomics.
